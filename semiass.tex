\begin{ass}\label{as:vol}\mbox{} 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The drift $b$ is progressively measurable, whereas the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$  is adapted and \cadlag.
    %\item Volatility is bounded away from zero on  \domain.
    \item There is a sequence of stopping times $\{T_m\}$ tending to infinity almost surely such that   
      \begin{align}
       E( \sup_{0 \le  s \le T_m} \vert b_s  - b_0\vert^4) + E( \sup_{0 \le  s \le T_m} \vert \sigma_s  - \sigma_0\vert^4)< \infty,\notag
        \label{}
      \end{align}
      for all $m$. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ass}
\begin{remark}
  These assumptions are satisfied by a wide range of practically relevant processes; these  include  continuous \levy and additive  processes with \cadlag  volatility coefficients. Also included are  continuous solutions of stochastic differential equations; indeed  all processes with locally bounded $b$ and $\sigma$ satisfy these requirements.
