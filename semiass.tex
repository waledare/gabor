\begin{ass}\label{as:vol}\mbox{} 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Spot volatility $\sigma$ is a strictly positive and adapted stochastic process  with continuous paths on \domain.  
    \item The drift coefficient $b$ is adapted and \cadlag on \domain. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ass}
\noindent The asymptotic results we shall establish  rely heavily on the modulus of continuity of realized spot variance, so, it is not immediately clear that the continuity assumption can be further weakened.     
The right-continuity assumption (\cadlag is a French abbreviation for right continuous, with finite left limits)  on the drift ensures that the drift coefficient is pathwise bounded on \domain. Likewise, the spot variance is pathwise bounded as a result of the continuity assumption.
