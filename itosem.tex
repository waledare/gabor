%\subsection{Ito semimartingales}
We fix a filtered probability space $(\Omega, \mcal{F}, \{\mcal{F}_t\}_{t \ge 0}, \p)$. We recall the definition of an \ito semimartingale with \levy jumps.  
\begin{defn}
  An $\real$-valued process $X$ is an \ito semimartingale with \levy jumps if it admits the representation:
  \begin{align}
    X_t = X_0 + \int^t_0 b_s ds + \int^t_0 \sigma_s d W_s  + x  I_{\{\vert x \vert > 1\}} \ast \mu_t  + x  I_{\{\vert x \vert \le  1\}} \ast (\mu - \nu)_t 
    \label{eq:semimartingale}
  \end{align}
  with 
  \begin{align}
    \nu(dt, dx) = F(dx) dt, \notag
    \label{}
  \end{align}
  $t \ge 0$, where $W$ is a Brownian motion, $\sigma$ and $b$ are \real-valued progressively measurable processes, $\mu$ is an integer-valued measure induced by the jumps  of $X$, $\nu$ is its \levy system, and $F(dx)$ is a  deterministic $\sigma$-finite measure on \real. 
\end{defn}
\begin{remark}
  Generally, \ito semimartingales are those with characteristic triplet $(b, \sigma, \nu)$ that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Here, we further restrict the \levy system $\nu$ to be deterministic. This assumption ensures the jump measure $\mu$ is a Poisson random measure. 
\end{remark}
