\section{Conclusion}
We have investigated estimators of the instantaneous volatility of asset prices for   entire time windows based on Gabor frame expansions of the realized trajectory of spot volatility. The main practical advantage of this type of estimator is their versatility. Once an estimate obtained various functionals of instantaneous volatility such as the ubiquitous integrated volatility are obtained immediately. We derived our estimators of global instantaneous volatility under the assumption that  the price process is an  \ito semimartingale with \levy jumps. We have also assumed that the  densities of the first and second predictable characteristics  belong to the localized class of processes with finite fourth moment. 

We proposed a preliminary  version of the estimator to be used in situations where the assumption of continuous asset prices hold. Under the  assumption  that observations of the asset price occur at discrete   equidistant intervals with a mesh tending to zero within a fixed time interval, we have shown using standard arguments that the estimator converges in probability in \Ltwo.  In the case of asset prices with discontinuous prices, we modified the basic estimator  to require the computation of the Gabor frame coefficients to depend on a threshold. The threshold itself is allowed to shrink to zero at a sufficiently slow rate to ensure consistency of the estimator in \Ltwo.
