\section{Conclusion}
We have investigated two types of estimators of the instantaneous volatility of asset prices. These estimators provide estimates of spot volatility not at a single point in time but for an  entire time window. The main practical advantage of this type of estimator is their versatility. Once an estimate obtained various functionals of instantaneous volatility such as the ubiquitous integrated volatility are obtained immediately. Our contribution is two fold: we obtain estimators using frames, which have documented advantages over orthonormal basis such as wavelets and Fourier series; secondly, by modifying  the basic estimator, we obtain an estimator of global spot volatility  that remains consistent even in the presence of price jumps.
